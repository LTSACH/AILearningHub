DATASET INFORMATION
================================================================================

Extraction Method:
  The data was extracted from the 1994 Census database using the following 
  conditions:
  ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0))

Prediction Task:
  Determine whether a person makes over $50,000 per year.

Dataset Statistics:
  - Total instances: 48,842
  - Training set: 32,561 samples
  - Test set: 16,281 samples
  - Features: 14 (6 numerical + 8 categorical)
  - Target: Binary classification (<=50K, >50K)

Missing Data:
  - Total instances with unknown values: 3,620
  - Instances without unknown values: 45,222
  - Duplicate or conflicting instances: 6

Class Distribution:
  - Probability for '>50K': 23.93% / 24.78% (without unknowns)
  - Probability for '<=50K': 76.07% / 75.22% (without unknowns)

DATA PREPROCESSING (THIS REPOSITORY)
================================================================================

The CSV files in this repository have been preprocessed for convenience:

Changes Applied:
  1. Added column names (original data has no headers)
  2. Replaced '?' with NaN for missing values
  3. Removed extra whitespace from all string columns
  4. Standardized target labels (removed trailing '.' from test set)
  5. Converted to standard CSV format

Original Data Format:
  - No column headers
  - Missing values encoded as ' ?'
  - Extra whitespace after commas
  - Test set has '<=50K.' and '>50K.' (with dots)

Preprocessing Script:

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Important Notes:
  ⚠️ This dataset contains sensitive demographic attributes (sex, race, 
     native country) from 1994 US Census data.
  
  ⚠️ Historical bias: The data reflects societal conditions and biases 
     from 1994, which may not represent current demographics or economics.
  
  ⚠️ Use responsibly: This dataset should be used for educational and 
     research purposes with awareness of potential biases.
  
  ⚠️ Fairness considerations: When building models, consider fairness 
     metrics beyond accuracy, especially regarding protected attributes.

Recommended Practices:
  - Analyze bias in model predictions across demographic groups
  - Use fairness-aware machine learning techniques
  - Consider ethical implications of income prediction models
  - Document limitations and potential biases in your work
