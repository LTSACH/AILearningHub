# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is the foundation of machine learning and statistical modeling.

## Overview
Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear approach. It's the simplest and most widely used regression technique.

## Mathematical Foundation
- **Simple Linear Regression**: y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
- **Matrix Form**: **y** = **Xβ** + **ε**

## Key Concepts
- **Least Squares Method**: Minimizing sum of squared residuals
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm for finding optimal parameters
- **Normal Equation**: Closed-form solution for linear regression
- **Assumptions**: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality

## Applications
- **Economics**: Demand forecasting, price prediction
- **Healthcare**: Medical diagnosis, treatment outcomes
- **Business**: Sales forecasting, risk assessment
- **Engineering**: Quality control, system modeling

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the mathematical foundation of linear regression
- Implement linear regression from scratch and using libraries
- Visualize regression results and interpret coefficients
- Apply linear regression to real-world problems
