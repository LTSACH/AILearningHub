# üìä Data Analysis

Welcome to the Data Analysis section of AI Learning Hub! This is where you learn the essential skills for understanding, cleaning, and preparing data before applying machine learning algorithms.

## Why Data Analysis?

> "Garbage in, garbage out." - Every data scientist ever

Data analysis is the foundation of successful AI and machine learning projects. Before building sophisticated models, you need to:

- **Understand** what your data actually contains
- **Clean** messy, incomplete, or inconsistent data
- **Transform** raw data into meaningful features
- **Validate** assumptions and hypotheses
- **Visualize** patterns and relationships

**The Reality:** Data scientists spend 60-80% of their time on data analysis and preparation, not modeling. Master these skills first!

## Learning Path

### 1. üìà [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](./01_EDA/)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Available

Learn to systematically explore datasets, uncover patterns, and understand data distributions.

**Topics:**
- Statistical summaries and distributions
- Data visualization techniques
- Pattern discovery and anomaly detection
- Text analysis (word frequency, TF-IDF, n-grams)
- Category similarity analysis

**Examples:**
- [BBC News Text Classification](./01_EDA/bbcnews_text_classification/eda_report_tutorial.html) - Interactive tutorial with copy-paste code

**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, Pandas  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty:** üü¢ Beginner to Intermediate

### 2. üßπ Data Cleaning
**Status:** ‚è≥ Coming Soon

Handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

**Topics:**
- Missing value analysis and imputation
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Duplicate removal strategies
- Data type conversions
- Consistency validation

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering
**Status:** ‚è≥ Coming Soon

Transform raw data into features that improve model performance.

**Topics:**
- Categorical encoding (Label, One-Hot, Target)
- Numerical scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Feature creation and extraction
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Feature selection techniques

---

### 4. üìä Statistical Analysis
**Status:** ‚è≥ Coming Soon

Apply statistical methods to validate hypotheses and understand relationships.

**Topics:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation and causation
- A/B testing
- Statistical distributions

---

## Quick Start

### For Beginners
Start with **EDA on text data**:
1. Go to [01_EDA/](./01_EDA/)
2. Open the [BBC News Tutorial](./01_EDA/bbcnews_text_classification/eda_report_tutorial.html)
3. Follow along with interactive examples
4. Copy code snippets to try yourself

### For Intermediate Learners
Focus on **understanding the methodology**:
1. Read the [EDA README](./01_EDA/README.md)
2. Study different data types (text, tabular, time series)
3. Practice on your own datasets
4. Compare raw vs. processed data analyses

## Tools & Libraries

```python
# Essential libraries for data analysis
import pandas as pd              # Data manipulation
import numpy as np               # Numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Basic plotting
import seaborn as sns           # Statistical visualization
import plotly.express as px     # Interactive plots

# Text analysis
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from collections import Counter

# Statistical analysis
from scipy import stats
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Always Do
- **Start with questions**: What do you want to learn from the data?
- **Visualize early and often**: Plots reveal insights statistics miss
- **Document everything**: Your future self will thank you
- **Check data quality first**: Missing values, duplicates, outliers
- **Understand the domain**: Context matters for interpretation
- **Iterate**: Data analysis is never truly "done"

### ‚ùå Never Do
- Skip EDA and jump to modeling
- Ignore outliers without investigation
- Remove data without understanding why
- Trust summary statistics blindly
- Forget to check for data leakage
- Over-engineer features prematurely

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Insufficient EDA
**Problem:** Rushing to model building without understanding the data  
**Solution:** Spend adequate time on EDA, aim for 30-40% of project time

### Mistake 2: Wrong Data Representation
**Problem:** Using raw data when you should filter, or vice versa  
**Solution:** Understand when to use raw vs. processed data for different analyses

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Data Distribution
**Problem:** Assuming normal distribution when it's not  
**Solution:** Always plot distributions before choosing preprocessing techniques

### Mistake 4: Correlation ‚â† Causation
**Problem:** Making causal claims from correlation  
**Solution:** Use controlled experiments or causal inference methods
